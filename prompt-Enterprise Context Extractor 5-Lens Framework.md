# General Document Analysis: Building a Comprehensive Context Body

Analyze the **content that I will provide in my next message, whether it's plain text or an image**. Your primary goal is to **extract and synthesize all information relevant to problem definition and system understanding**, specifically to build a comprehensive body of background context for the 'Domain-Driven Discovery + Product Discovery Fusion' framework.

**Important: Provide ONLY the structured analysis output below, with no conversational preamble, closing remarks, or additional questions.**

**For each point of extracted information, explicitly label it as `[Directly Stated]` if it's explicitly found in the content, or `[Inferred/Contextual]` if it's derived through interpretation, correlation, or general knowledge applied to the content. If information for a category is missing, clearly state `[Information Missing]` for that specific bullet point or section within the category.**

Please thoroughly extract and summarize the following details.
