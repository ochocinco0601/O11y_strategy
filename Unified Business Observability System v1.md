---

### **✅ Template Validation Checklist**

Use this checklist to ensure each step’s template is complete and ready for signal mapping and dashboard design.

| Validation Item | Criteria | Owner/Reviewer |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Step is clearly named | Unique and descriptive; understandable to both business and tech | Product Owner |
| Business process is accurately linked | Aligns with larger value stream or domain | Product Owner |
| Technical function is described | Includes system behavior, logic, and inputs/outputs | Developer / Architect |
| Business function is articulated | Explains why the step matters and to whom | Product Owner / Analyst |
| Customers/internal users are identified | Lists affected or dependent personas | Product Owner |
| User goals are defined | Clearly explains what users are trying to achieve | Product Owner / UX |
| KPIs are listed with targets and owners | Includes threshold, description, and responsible party | Product Owner / Data Analyst |
| Business signals are present | At least one meaningful value signal exists | Product Owner / Developer |
| Performance reliability signals are present | Includes both process and system-level signals | Developer / SRE |
| Signal ownership is clear | Every signal has a defined accountable party | Observability Facilitator |
| Mini reference card is ready | Final format reviewed; used to guide dashboards | Cross-functional team |

---

### **🛡️ Why Ownership Traceability Matters**

As organizations scale, the complexity of distributed systems grows — and with it, the risk of losing accountability. Ownership traceability within business observability is not a “nice to have” — it is essential for ensuring:

* ✅ **Accountability**: Every KPI and signal must be owned by a specific role or team.

* ✅ **Auditability**: Clear links between dashboard signals and upstream artifacts enable reviews, escalation handling, and governance.

* ✅ **Governance**: A consistent ownership model supports incident response, risk management, and compliance oversight.

This system explicitly teaches ownership, relevance, and responsibility at each layer — from signal design to dashboard execution. Traceability is what makes business observability operationally dependable and scalable in large organizations.

To ensure this principle is upheld, each business step should include a completed **Ownership Traceability Table**.

### **📊 Ownership Traceability Template**

| Observed Signal / KPI | Owner (Dashboard Context) | Owner in Signal Table | Template Field Owner | Confirmed in Persona Guide? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| \[Insert signal or KPI here\] | \[e.g., SRE, PO, Developer\] | \[e.g., listed in mini card\] | \[e.g., KPI → PO / Analyst\] | ✅ or ⚠ or ❌ |

---

## **🧠 Meta Validation Checklist: System Design Principles**

Use this checklist to review whether a completed set of business observability documentation (templates, dashboards, signals, traceability) adheres to your core system design beliefs.

| Validation Dimension | What to Look For | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Ubiquitous Language** | Are key terms (e.g., KPI, Signal, Step, Owner) used consistently across artifacts? | Reduces friction, improves comprehension across roles |
| **Ownership** | Does every KPI, signal, and action have a named accountable role? | Enables traceability, accountability, and operational focus |
| **Relevance** | Is each signal/KPI tied back to a business outcome or user goal? | Ensures observability drives business value |
| **Responsibility** | Are roles not only named, but aware of what they’re expected to do? | Reinforces operational clarity and prevents ambiguity |
| **Traceability** | Can you trace a dashboard metric back to its definition, owner, and rationale? | Enables auditability and incident accountability |
| **Governance** | Is there a clear handoff or sign-off when readiness criteria are met? | Supports scale, compliance, and consistency |
| **Modularity & Reuse** | Are templates, guides, and reference cards reusable across business flows? | Accelerates onboarding and standardizes practices |

If any dimension scores ⚠ or ❌, refine the related artifacts before onboarding additional teams or expanding system use.

## **🤖 GenAI Prompt Library for Business Observability Support**

Use this section to catalog and design GenAI prompts that help users create, fill out, reason through, validate, and evolve the business observability system. Prompts should map to specific artifacts, roles, or phases of the implementation process.

| Use Case | Prompt Goal | Target Role(s) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 🧱 Kickstarting a New Step | Generate a filled template for a given business step description | Product Owner, App Dev |
| 🧩 Role-Specific Field Completion | Provide guided assistance filling out each template field by role | Product Owner, SRE, Developer |
| 📊 Generate Observability Signal Matrix Row | Map signals to a business step based on a filled template | Observability Engineer |
| 📈 Generate Dashboard Mockup | Create a text-based dashboard from signals and KPIs | SRE, Product Owner |
| 🧾 Draft Mini Reference Card | Turn a completed template \+ matrix into a mini reference card | Facilitators, Documentation Lead |
| 🛡️ Auto-generate Ownership Traceability Table | Generate traceability links from dashboards back to roles and docs | Observability Lead, QA |
| ✅ Checklist Validation Assistant | Evaluate artifacts against validation checklists (template/meta) | Governance / Tech Leads |
| 📚 Explain System Structure | Help new team members understand how all artifacts work together | Onboarding Users / New Teams |

Each prompt should align with your principle of teaching **ownership, relevance, and responsibility**, and assist in scaling adoption across teams.

## **🧩 Prompt Matrix: Signal & Step Type Combinations for GenAI Assistance**

Use this matrix to guide prompt generation based on the **type of signal** and the **type of step** a team is working on. This helps tailor onboarding, documentation, and reasoning support for different observability contexts. This version reflects 'Performance Reliability Signals' as a top-level category with two subtypes: Process and System.

| Signal Type | Step Type | Prompt Guidance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Business Signal** | Execution | What business outcome should be achieved if this step is successful? What KPI reflects that outcome? |
| **Business Signal** | Validation | What customer or compliance risk exists if this validation fails? What business outcome does it protect? |
| **Business Signal** | Compliance | What regulation or internal policy must be satisfied here? How does the signal demonstrate that? |
| **Performance Reliability — Process** | Execution | What process logic must run correctly for this step to complete? How can we verify it did? |
| **Performance Reliability — Process** | Validation | What field, rule, or logic must be satisfied at this step? How do we confirm its correctness? |
| **Performance Reliability — Process** | Fulfillment | What sequence or handoff must complete? What are signs the step is stuck or misfiring? |
| **Performance Reliability — System** | Execution | What platform or system supports this step? What system-level telemetry reflects its health? |
| **Performance Reliability — System** | Validation | Are there systems that perform or support validation? What failures would interrupt the business logic? |
| **Performance Reliability — System** | Compliance | What infrastructure or system requirements must be met for compliance? How do we observe them? |

You can combine this matrix with role-specific guidance (e.g., Product Owner, SRE) to construct high-quality GenAI prompts that match each use case.
