# Event Management Overview

## 1. What is Event Management?

**Event Management** is the process of detecting, interpreting, classifying, and responding to events generated by monitoring tools, infrastructure, applications, or business systems. It is a foundational capability for effective operations, observability, and incident management.

An **event** is any detectable occurrence that has significance for system hardware, software, or business process performance.

## 2. Why It Matters

- **Reduces mean time to detect (MTTD)** and resolve issues
- Enables **early warning** through correlated signals and thresholds
- Supports **automated remediation** and intelligent alerting
- Improves **visibility into service health** and business KPIs
- Helps answer: _“What’s happening, where, and why?”_

## 3. Event Types

| **Type**         | **Description**                                              | **Example**                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Informational**| Event confirming normal behavior or successful execution     | Backup completed, service started        |
| **Warning**      | Early indicator of a potential issue or threshold breach     | CPU at 85%, retry attempts detected      |
| **Exception**    | Deviation from normal operation, failure, or error           | Payment API timed out, service crash     |

## 4. Event Lifecycle

**The typical lifecycle of an event:**

→ **Generated**  
→ **Detected**  
→ **Filtered**  
→ **Correlated**  
→ **Classified**  
→ **Responded**  
→ **Resolved**

Each stage is critical to ensuring the right events are surfaced, enriched, and acted upon without overwhelming teams with noise.

## 5. Best Practices for Effective Event Management

### 5.1 Standardize Event Classification

- Use a shared taxonomy (e.g., by `layer`, `service`, `signal`, `cause`, `symptom`, etc.)
- Categorize events as `informational`, `warning`, or `exception` based on business impact and urgency
- Tag events with business KPIs and process stages where applicable

### 5.2 Automate Detection and Routing

- Use observability tools to auto-generate events from logs, metrics, traces, and synthetics
- Integrate events with a centralized pipeline (e.g., BigPanda, Splunk, APM)
- Route events to the correct team based on tags or configuration items

### 5.3 Apply Event Filtering and Correlation

- Suppress noise using deduplication, flapping detection, and maintenance windows
- Use correlation logic to group related events into a single incident or alert
- Prioritize based on `impact`, `urgency`, and business relevance

### 5.4 Establish Clear Response Protocols

- Document playbooks for each common event or service
- Automate safe remediation actions (e.g., service restarts, ticket creation)
- Escalate via defined on-call rotations or escalation policies

### 5.5 Continuously Improve Event Quality

- Review top recurring events for tuning or elimination
- Analyze unclassified or unhandled events to enhance enrichment rules
- Use post-incident reviews to validate which events mattered

## 6. Event vs. Alert vs. Incident

| **Concept** | **Definition** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Event**   | A raw or enriched occurrence with operational or business significance |
| **Alert**   | A notification generated from one or more events requiring attention |
| **Incident**| A tracked issue that has impacted service delivery or customer experience |
